## Suggested adoption modes

### One-day workshop

Use Modules 1C, 2A, 2C, and a short version of 4B. The learning objective is to distinguish a validated numerical label from a convenient training target and to compare a neural model with interpolation.

### Six-week intensive course

Use all modules in order. Assign one controlled project modification in Weeks 5–6. Advanced Track 6 remains instructor-approved.

### Full semester

Expand each row into a lecture/lab pair. Add grid/time-step studies, multi-parameter or geometry-varying data, a dedicated neural-operator unit, uncertainty calibration, and a research-resolution final project.

## Assessment philosophy

Assess evidence rather than software completion. Recommended final-project categories are:

1. scientific question and matched baseline;
2. split and model-selection discipline;
3. numerical metrics;
4. physical validation;
5. failure/limitation analysis;
6. reproducibility; and
7. scientific communication.

No category should require the ML method to outperform the baseline.
