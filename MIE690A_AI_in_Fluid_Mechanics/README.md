# MIE 690A — AI in Fluid Mechanics

Complete, self-study-ready computational materials from the six-week graduate course **MIE 690A: AI in Fluid Mechanics**, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Summer 2026.

The course treats scientific machine learning as a controlled computational-physics experiment:

1. generate or audit numerical data;
2. define a physically meaningful learning problem;
3. separate development, validation, and blind physical cases;
4. compare with a transparent non-neural baseline;
5. evaluate both statistical and physical fidelity; and
6. retain failure modes, configuration, and machine-readable evidence.

Start with [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md). It gives the installation check, recommended order, expected runtimes, and a first 20-minute validation exercise.

## Learning sequence

The recommended path is cumulative:

- **Week 1 — Numerical foundations:** Python/NumPy/TensorFlow fundamentals, finite differences, residuals, and validation of lid-driven-cavity centerlines against Ghia et al.
- **Week 2 — Supervised learning and model validity:** features, targets, scaling, losses, optimization, case-wise splits, interpolation versus extrapolation, and rarefied-flow nondimensionalization.
- **Week 3 — Particle and kinetic descriptions:** Maxwellian sampling, macroscopic moments, sampling-error scaling, DSMC algorithmic structure, noisy labels, and averaging.
- **Week 4 — Surrogates and operator learning:** audited CFD fields, scalar baselines, coordinate DNNs, and a restricted POD-DeepONet with complete-case selection, three-seed blind tests, Ghia validation, physical diagnostics, and measured inference cost.
- **Weeks 5–6 — Controlled research project:** select one track—including POD, physics-guided learning, uncertainty, rarefied flow, or learned closure—freeze the protocol, open blind cases once, document a failure/tradeoff, and produce a reproducible research summary.

The full module-to-evidence mapping is in [COURSE_MAP.md](COURSE_MAP.md).

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python qa/validate_course_release.py
python common/article_validation.py all
```

For Google Colab, upload the notebook and the files named in its **Required files** section. Project notebooks also contain a repository bootstrap cell, so they can be launched from this checkout without manually copying `common/` or `data/` files.

TensorFlow is needed for the neural-network training cells. The numerical audit, interpolation, POD, data checks, and notebook syntax validation can be run without a GPU. Track 6 requires a CUDA-capable runtime for its final closed-loop run; its fast-mode configuration is only a smoke test, not research-resolution evidence.

## Common benchmark and data contract

The shared dataset contains full `u`, `v`, `p`, `psi`, and `omega` fields on a fixed grid for

`Re = 100, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 350, 375, 400`.

The streamfunction–vorticity solver is an educational reference. Re = 100 and 400 include Ghia centerline checks; all cases retain numerical residuals and a zero-mean pressure gauge. A smoother surrogate is not automatically more physically accurate than the CFD labels.

The reference dataset SHA-256 is recorded in `common/reproducibility.txt` and checked by the release validator.

The Week-1 cavity notebook now opens with both velocity and pressure validation. The Week-3 DSMC notebook opens with a direct comparison of our executed solver against Mohammadzadeh *et al.* at the same $Re=1.5$, $Kn=0.1$, $Ma=0.09$ condition. Both notebooks generate the exact paper-facing figures through `common/article_validation.py`; optional switches expose the full numerical reruns without forcing every learner to wait for them.

## Executed POD-DeepONet result

Run `python common/run_pod_deeponet_validation.py` to reproduce the CPU study. The development-only rule selects a rank-3 POD trunk and a `(32,32)` tanh branch. The untouched `Re = 175, 275, 375` fields have three-seed ensemble velocity errors of **0.4525%**, **0.0718%**, and **0.0928%**. Wall error is exactly zero by the declared output transform and the discrete divergence norm remains at round-off because the trunk is built from divergence-free CFD snapshots.

This result does **not** claim that the network improves the Ghia benchmark. At `Re = 100` and `400`, POD-DeepONet preserves the centerline fidelity of the educational CFD solver. Its demonstrated advantage is amortized field evaluation after training: approximately 0.8 ms for the three-seed ensemble versus approximately 8 s for a fresh CPU CFD solve in the recorded run. Exact machine-readable values, protocol, seeds, fields, and the comparison figure are in `results/pod_deeponet/`.

## Rules that apply to every project

- Split complete physical cases when the claim concerns a new Reynolds number, Knudsen number, wall speed, seed, or operating condition.
- Fit scalers and select models using development data only.
- Freeze architecture, rank, loss weights, stopping rules, and rejection thresholds before blind testing.
- Compare neural models with a transparent baseline using the same allowed information.
- Report local physics diagnostics alongside aggregate error norms.
- Treat a negative result as valid when the comparison is controlled and reproducible.
- Do not describe reduced teaching budgets as production convergence evidence.
